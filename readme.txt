0. Note

   The Moxa UPort 11x0 USB to Serial Hub driver can be used in the Linux
   kernel with the usbcore and usbserial modules. This two modules is
   built-in module in the Linux kernel version 2.6.x and follow. In the
   Linux kernel version, you must check this two build-in modules existed.
   Otherwise, you will fail to using MOXA UPort 11x0 USB to Serial Hub driver.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Introduction

   The MOXA UPort 11x0 USB to Serial Hub Linux driver supports following 
   devices. 

    - UPort 1110, 1 port RS-232 USB to Serial Hub.
    - UPort 1130, 1 port RS-422/485 USB to Serial Hub.
    - UPort 1130I, 1 port RS-422/485 USB to Serial Hub with isolation
      protection.
    - UPort 1150, 1 port RS-232/422/485 USB to Serial Hub.
    - UPort 1150I, 1 port RS-232/422/485 USB to Serial Hub with isolation
      protection.

   This driver supports x86 and x64(AMD64/EM64T) hardware platform. In 
   order to maintain compatibility, this version has also been properly 
   tested with several Linux distribution (see version.txt). However, 
   if compatibility problem occurs, please contact Moxa Technologies
   technical support. (support@moxa.com.tw)

   All the drivers are published in form of source code under
   GNU General Public License in this version. Please refer to GNU General
   Public License announcement in each source code file for more detail.

   This version of driver can be only installed as Loadable Module (Module 
   driver). Before you install the driver, please refer to hardware installation
   procedure in the User's Manual.

3. Installation

   3.1 Driver files   
   3.2 Device naming convention
   3.3 Module driver configuration
   3.4 Static driver configuration 
   3.5 Verify driver installation
       
   3.1 Driver files

       The driver file may be obtained from CD-ROM or floppy disk.
       The first step, is to copy driver file
       "driv_linux2.6_uport1p_v1.2_build_xx.tgz" into specified
       directory. e.g. /moxa. The execute commands as below.

       # cd / 
       # mkdir moxa 		
       # cd /moxa
       # cp /dev/fd0/driv_linux2.6_uport1p_v1.2_build_xx.tgz
       # tar xvfz driv_linux2.6_uport1p_v1.2_build_xx.tgz
       
       or
       
       # cd /
       # mkdir moxa
       # cd /moxa
       # cp /mnt/cdrom/<driver directory>/driv_linux2.6_uport1p_v1.2_build_xx.tgz
       # tar xvfz driv_linux2.6_uport1p_v1.2_build_xx.tgz

   3.2 Device naming convention
   
       You may find all the driver files in /<driver directory>/mxu11x0/.
       Following installation procedure depends on the model you'd like to
       run the driver.

       Dialin and callout port
       -----------------------
       This driver remains traditional serial device properties. Because the
       limitation of the usb build-in modules that are usbcore and usbserial, 
       There is only one special file name for each serial port. This one is 
       dial-in port which is named "ttyUSBxx". 

   3.3 Module driver configuration

       3.3.1 Build the MOXA driver
          Before using the MOXA driver, you need compile the all the source 
          code. This step is only need to be executed once.
          But you still re-compile the source code if you modify the source
          code. 
                    
          Find "Makefile" in /moxa/mxu11x0/driver, then run

	  	  # make clean; make install

	  The driver files "mxu11x0.ko" will be properly compiled
	  and copied to system directories respectively. 
          
       3.3.2 Load the MOXA driver  

	  The driver will be loaded automatically while pluging the 
          UPort 1110/1130/1130I/1150/1150I into you PC. Besides, you can load 
          the driver manually.
	  
	  # modprobe mxu11x0 

	  It will activate the module driver. You may run "lsmod" to check
	  if "mxu11x0" is activated. Before you load this module driver, you
	  have to run "lsmod" to check if "usbcore" and "usbserial" are 
          activated.

   3.4 Static driver configuration
       
       Note: To use static driver, you must install the linux kernel
             source package.
   
       3.4.1 Create link
	  # cd /usr/src/<kernel-source directory>/drivers/usb/serial/
	  # ln -s /moxa/mxu11x0/driver/mxu11x0.c mxu11x0.c
	  # ln -s /moxa/mxu11x0/driver/mxu11x0.h mxu11x0.h
	  # ln -s /moxa/mxu11x0/driver/mxu1110_fw.h mxu1110_fw.h
	  # ln -s /moxa/mxu11x0/driver/mxu1130_fw.h mxu1130_fw.h
	  # ln -s /moxa/mxu11x0/driver/mxu1131_fw.h mxu1131_fw.h
	  # ln -s /moxa/mxu11x0/driver/mxu1150_fw.h mxu1150_fw.h
	  # ln -s /moxa/mxu11x0/driver/mxu1151_fw.h mxu1151_fw.h

       3.4.2 Modify kernel configuration file.
          Add the following line into configuration file.
	  /usr/src/<kernel-source directory>/drivers/usb/serial/Kconfig
		...
		config USB_SERIAL_CONSOLE
		...
		config USB_SERIAL_GENERIC
		...
		config MOXA_UPORT_11X0			      <-- Add the lines.
			tristate "USB Moxa UPort 11x0 Driver" <-- 
			depends on USB_SERIAL		      <--
		...

       3.4.3 Modify the kernel Makefile 
	  Add the following line to the last line of Makefile.
	  /usr/src/<kernel-source directory>/drviers/usb/serial/Makefile
		...
		...
		...
		obj-$(CONFIG_MOXA_UPORT_11X0) += mxu11x0.o <-- Add the line.

       3.4.4 Setup kernel configuration
          
          Configure the kernel:

            # cd /usr/src/<kernel-source directory>
            # make menuconfig
            
          You will go into a menu-driven system. Please select [Device Drivers]
	  [USB Support], [USB Serial Converter support], enable both the 
	  [USB Serial Converter support] and the [USB MOXA UPORT 11x0 Driver]
          drivers with "[*]" by pressing space bar for built-in (not "[M]"),
	  then select [Exit] to exit this program and save kernel
	  configurations. 
          
       3.4.5 Rebuild kernel
      	  The following are for Linux kernel rebuilding, for your 
          reference only.
	  For appropriate details, please refer to the Linux document.

	  a. cd /usr/src/<kernel-source directory>
	  b. make 	     
	  c. make modules	
	  d. make modules_install
	  e. make install

   3.5 Verify driver installation
       You may refer to /var/log/messages to check the latest status
       log reported by this driver whenever it's activated.
       
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. Setserial

   NOTE: To use the setserial tools, you have to install it first.
	 The setserial is a free software, you can download it on 
	 http://sourceforge.net/projects/setserial/ .

   MOXA UPort 1130/1130I provides three interfaces(RS-485 2W, RS-485 4W, RS-422) 
   and UPort 1150/1150I provides four interfaces(RS-232, RS-485 2W, RS-485 4W,
   RS-422). If you want to switch different interface, you can execute the
   setserial command to set the port's interface. The supported parameter is
   listed below.

	parameter	value   interface	

	port            0	RS-232
                        1	RS-485 2W
                        2	RS-422
                        3	RS-485 4W

  For example:	
	To set the port's informations:
	# setserial /dev/ttyUSB0 port 1

	To get the port's informations:
	# setserial -G /dev/ttyUSB0
   
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
5. Limitation 
   1. Max. ports
      If you want to install more than one UPort USB serial Hub, the best
      way is to connect to USB port directly. In lab test, four USB ports 
      with four UPort 1110/1130/1130I/1150/1150I still work very well. If we 
      connect to USB hub, the throughput will be dropped down. To get good
      performance,please connecting UPort 1110/1130/1150/1150I to USB port 
      directly .
         	

   2. Compile error
      To build Moxa driver, it needs kernel header files. If you got
      some compile error, please run "rpm -qa | grep kernel" to check 
      whether the kernel-source package is installed properly. If not,
      please get the kernel-source irpm package and run "rpm -ivh <pacakge>"
      to install. You also need to make sure the build tool is ready,
      including make/gcc/lib. Please see Linux relative document to 
      get more information.
      
   3. Probe error
      The UPort 1110/1130/1130I/1150/1150I needs firmware downloaded after 
      attaching to PC. Hence, the driver will reset the 
      UPort 1110/1130/1130I/1150/1150I after downloading firmware and probe the
      UPort 1110/1130/1130I/1150/1150I again.After that, the
      UPort 1110/1130/1130I/1150/1150I will attach to the /dev/ttyUSBxx. 
      Therefore, the message "mxusb:probe of x-x:x.x failed with error -5" 
      will show only once before successfully installing the device. You may 
      refer to /dev/ttyUSBxx to see if the UPort 1110/1130/1130I/1150/1150I 
      is set correctly.
